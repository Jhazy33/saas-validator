## 💡 My Recommendation

### **Build the Web App** ✅

**Why?**

1. **You Already Have the Backend** - The CLI scripts work perfectly! You just need to add a UI wrapper.

2. **Market Opportunity** - $20M serviceable market, little competition in automated validation space.

3. **Revenue Potential** - $174K ARR in year 1, scaling to $1.74M by year 3.

4. **Fast to Build** - Only 4-6 weeks because you're reusing existing CLI scripts as backend workers.

5. **SaaS Business Model** - Recurring revenue, not one-time consulting or agency work.

6. **Universal Access** - Works on all devices, no installation needed.

7. **Complete Specs Ready** - You have PRD, roadmap, tech stack - ready to give to developers.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### **Risk 1: Market Doesn't Want Web UI**
**Mitigation:** Beta test with 100 users first, get feedback before full build

### **Risk 2: Competitor Launches First**
**Mitigation:** Move fast (4-6 weeks), focus on unique features (video input)

### **Risk 3: Technical Challenges**
**Mitigation:** Solid tech stack (Next.js + Supabase), thorough testing

### **Risk 4: Low Conversion to Paid**
**Mitigation:** Free tier limit (3 ideas/month), clear value proposition

### **Risk 5: High Churn**
**Mitigation:** Focus on retention (analytics, collaboration, templates)
