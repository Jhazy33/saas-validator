## 🎯 Opportunity

### **The Problem**

**Solo founders and indie hackers waste months building products nobody wants.**

- **90% of startups fail** because they build without validating

- **Generate landing pages** from any content (video, text, audio)
- **Test 10+ ideas per month** instead of 1 idea per quarter
- **Data-driven decisions** from real user behavior
- **Focus resources** on winners, kill losers quickly
