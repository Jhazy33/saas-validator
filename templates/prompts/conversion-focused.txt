**Tone**: Direct, action-oriented, benefit-focused, urgent

**Conversion Psychology**:
- Use specific numbers (not "many", use "500+")
- Create urgency (limited spots, early access)
- Social proof (testimonials, user count)
- Risk reversal (free trial, no credit card)
- Single, clear CTA per section

**Return Format**:
```json
{
  "headline": "Your Bold Headline Here",
  "subheadline": "Your compelling subheadline",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Problem",
      "body": "## You're Losing 20+ Hours Every Week\n\n- Manual work takes too long\n- Errors are costly\n- Scaling is impossible"
    },
    {
      "title": "Solution",
      "body": "## Automate Everything in 5 Minutes\n\nSave 20+ hours per week with AI-powered automation. Trusted by 500+ companies."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important**:
- Every claim must be specific (numbers, percentages, timeframes)
- If uncertain about a detail, respond with "I don't know" instead of guessing
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Include social proof throughout
- Create genuine urgency (not fake scarcity)
